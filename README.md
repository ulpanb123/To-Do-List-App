# To-Do-List-App
This simple to-do-list app is a part of "Android Fundamentals" course offered by Udacity. 
* In this app, a user can add new to-do tasks which will later be sorted by priority and provided as a list. Also, the user can update the already added tasks and delete by swiping the necessary task. 
* The app was built using basic Android architecture components such as LiveData, Room, and ViewModel.
